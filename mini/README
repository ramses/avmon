mini-monitor is a sample monitoring application to illustrate how to use the
avmon library. 

Running mini-monitor:
=====================

$ mini-monitor -c configuration-file.conf &    (1)
$ ./start                                      (2)
$ ./stop                                       (3)
$ ./start                                      (4)
$ ./quit                                       (5)

(1) run mini-monitor as a background process
(2) sends a message to mini-monitor's named pipe, telling it to join an avmon
    overlay
(3) sends a message to mini-monitor's named pipe, telling it to leave the
    previously joined overlay
(4) rejoin the overlay
(5) mini-monitor leaves the overlay and then exits


Configuration:
==============
sample1.conf shows how to configure mini-monitor to be the very first node in
an avmon overlay.  Notice that the node used to "join" the overlay is called
"none."

sample2.conf shows how to configure mini-monitor to join an existing avmon
overlay.

N = the approximate number of peers in the monitoring overlay. Future versions
will automagically estimate it.

K = usually c * log_2(N) for some constant c. The number of monitors per node
is on average K.
