AVMON currently works on Linux. Win and Mac platforms are planned.

If downloaded from CVS:
=======================

You'll need a system with GNU's autotools:

% autoreconf -ivf     #build the auto-configuration script
% ./configure         #./configure --help, for details
% make                #build the library and applications
% make install        #you might need to become root before this step

Official release source code:
=============================
% gunzip -c avmon-0.1.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
% cd avmon-0.1
% ./configure 
% make
% make install
